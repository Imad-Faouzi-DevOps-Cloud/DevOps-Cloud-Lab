This project simulates a 6-month DevOps consulting assignment performed as part of a Master 2 graduation internship in Control Systems Engineering. It was designed to replicate a typical DevOps mission delivered by an ESN (IT services company) such as Alten, Sopra Steria, or Capgemini, for a major financial client like BNP Paribas.

The mission involved building the infrastructure and deployment pipeline for a ticket management system (TaskManager) developed in FastAPI, and making it production-ready using real-world DevOps practices.
